# Proiect_Farmacie

This Java project processes two text files, "in.txt" and "produce.txt". The "in.txt" file contains various objects from a pharmacy, and the "products.txt" file contains a list of existing product types. The program reads and stores the products from "in.txt" in a collection, and then creates 3 lists for each type of product. Medicines are sorted by ID and the program checks for unique medical devices. This project involves several classes, each with a specific role.
